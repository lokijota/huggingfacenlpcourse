## Chain of Thought Reasoning

- Source: Google - Chain of Thought Reasoning. Overview here https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html and ArXiv here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903

Key ideas:
- *Chain of thought reasoning allows models to decompose complex problems into intermediate steps that are solved individually. Moreover, the language-based nature of chain of thought makes it applicable to any task that a person could solve via language. We find through empirical experiments that chain of thought prompting can improve performance on various reasoning tasks, and that successful chain of thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale â€” that is, the benefits of chain of thought prompting only materialize with a sufficient number of model parameters (around 100B).*
- Employing chain of thought prompting enables language models to solve **arithmetic reasoning problems** for which standard prompting has a mostly flat scaling curve.
